# Timezone Calculator

In this project you may find a simple Timezone Calculator that is very easy to use.
All you need to do is - add some cities and create yourself a little dashboard.
As soon as you hit the "Create Dashboard" button, the program calculates the result and displays the time on the screen.


The goal is to add also another method for calculating random time in another city.
This function is yet still in development process, but will be released any time soon! :)
Stay tuned!
