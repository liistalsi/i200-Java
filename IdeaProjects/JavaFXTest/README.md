# Timezone Calculator

In this project you may find a simple Timezone Calculator that is very easy to use.
All you need to do is - enter your current location City, and the target city.
As soon as you hit the "Calculate" button, the program calculates the result and displays it on the screen.

You are not allowed to enter empty values and non excisting words.

The goal is to add also another method for calculating random time in another city.
This function is yet still in development process, but will be released any time soon! 
Stay tuned!
